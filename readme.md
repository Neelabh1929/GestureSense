This Repo is for the Smart glove implementation done by me as a part of Exploration Project. 

PROJECT DETAILS:

The project centers around a glove that functions as a remote device, identifying specific finger combinations using variable resistances or flex sensors.

Once a finger combination is detected, the flex sensor data is sent to an Arduino UNO microcontroller. The Arduino UNO is pre-programmed with a set of instructions (a sketch) to determine appropriate responses based on the input data. The processed output from the Arduino UNO is then transmitted to a connected device using a Bluetooth module (HC-05).

To display the transmitted output, the Serial Bluetooth Terminal app (available on the Play Store) was utilized.

The primary objective of this project was to create a system that enables patients with certain disabilities to send emergency or essential messages effortlessly. This innovation allows them to connect with their caretakers immediately, improving communication and ensuring timely assistance.

SCALABILITY:

>This technology has the potential to be expanded for more advanced assistive features in smart devices, enhancing their functionality and accessibility.

>Number of gestures can be increased significantly by using binary codes and binary representation for each gesture.
